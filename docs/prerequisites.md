# Prerequisites

## Create a GitHub account
You will need to have a GitHub account in order to complete this lab. If you do not already have one, you can create a free account [here](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home){target=_blank}.

## Create a Docker account
Create a Docker account (if you don't already have one) following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-id/){target=_blank}.

## Create a Docker access token
Create an access token for Docker Hub access during the lab (you will delete it after finishing the lab) following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/#create-an-access-token){target=_blank}. If you already have a Docker account and already have a Docker access token, we recommend that you create a new access token just for this lab instead of using any existing ones.
