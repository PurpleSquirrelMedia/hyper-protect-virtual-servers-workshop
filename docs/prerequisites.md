# Prerequisites

## Create a GitHub account
You will need to have a GitHub account in order to complete this lab. If you do not already have one, you can create a free account [here](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home){target=_blank}.

## Create a GitHub personal access token
Create a GitHub personal access token for the lab by following steps 2-9 in the _Creating a token_ section of [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token){target=_blank} from the public GitHub documentation. You will delete this token at the end of the lab.  If you already have a GitHub account and already use GitHub personal access tokens, we recommend that you create a new personal access token just for this lab instead of using any existing personal access tokens.

For step 8, when selecting scopes, you only have to select the first check box that says _repo_. This will also select the subitems in the _repo_ sectionâ€”leave these subitems checked as well.

!!! note
    The instructions linked to in this step assume that you are signed in to your GitHub account, so open a new tab and navigate to _github.com_ if necessary, and click the _Sign In_ link to sign in.

## Create a Docker account
Create a Docker account (if you don't already have one) following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-id/){target=_blank}.

## Create a Docker access token
Create an access token for Docker Hub access during the lab (you will delete it after finishing the lab) following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/#create-an-access-token){target=_blank}. If you already have a Docker account and already have a Docker access token, we recommend that you create a new access token just for this lab instead of using any existing ones.
