# Hyper Protect Virtual Server Wildfire Workshop

Welcome to our Hyper Protect Virtual Server workshop. Hyper Protect Virtual Server is IBM’s open application environment that is uniquely engineered for trusted computing. This workshop provides a primer on Hyper Protect Virtual Server and practical use cases relevant to the enterprise. In addition, you will gain hands-on experience with IBM’s unique secure image build process to build a secure image and deploy it inside a FIPS 197-compliant protected memory enclave. Next, you will learn about Hyper Protect Virtual Server’s crypto service built on a FIPS 140-2 Level 4-compliant HSM. Lastly, you will gain hands-on experience exploiting the crypto service.
