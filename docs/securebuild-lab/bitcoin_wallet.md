# Use your bitcoin wallet application

## Overview 

This application is an secure Electrum Bitcoin wallet found at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/IBM/secure-bitcoin-wallet){_target=blank}. You can use it to store the identities necessary to transact on the Bitcoin public blockchain network. While this version of the wallet is just a proof of concept, running this type of wallet on Hyper Protect enables you to protect your digital assets from bad actors such as malicious server administrators.

!!! info 
    This Electrum Bitcoin wallet functions regularly, while inheriting the security benefits of the Hyper Protect Virtual Server platform. This ensures that a legitimate version of the application is running (Secure Image Build process) and that administrators cannot compromise the application (Hyper Protect Virtual Server deployment).
