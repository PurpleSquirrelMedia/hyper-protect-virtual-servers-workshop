# How to propose a change

On the page that you want to make a change to, click on the pencil icon next to the page's title. This will take you to edit the page in Github.

You will see a message similar to the following: "You’re editing a file in a project you don’t have write access to. Submitting a change to this file will write it to a new branch in your fork, so you can send a pull request."

The owners of this repo will review your pull request and accept or deny your change proposal.

There other other ways of doing a pull request, a Google search will lead you to those tutorials.
